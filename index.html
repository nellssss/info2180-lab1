        <p class="ppp">I am a part-time Computer Science student, and over time I have grown to both understand and appreciate the program, 
            even though I am still fairly new to the field. I chose to study Dynamic Web Development because we live in an era 
            where the web plays such a vital role, and I believe these skills will be very useful in the future. I also plan to 
            continue on to Part 2 of the course. Additionally, I find it fascinating to learn how web pages and websites are created, 
            and I believe this course provides valuable exposure.
